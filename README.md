# Pomodoro app

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Pomodoro timer app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided.
All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
